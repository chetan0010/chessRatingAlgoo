In competitive chess, accurately measuring player performance and predicting outcomes are essential for fair rankings and tournament management. Traditional rating systems like Elo and Glicko provide reliable frameworks for rating calculation based on match outcomes, but they often fall short in addressing complexities such as player inactivity, rating volatility, and performance prediction. This project presents a comprehensive chess rating management system that integrates classical Elo and Glicko rating algorithms with machine learning techniques including Random Forest classifiers and Gradient Descent optimizers to enhance rating accuracy and forecast match results. 
The system is developed using Python, with a Tkinter-based graphical user interface offering users an intuitive platform to simulate matches, manage player profiles, and visualize rating changes. The core rating logic dynamically updates player ratings based on match results and prediction models trained on historical data, providing both traditional and data-driven perspectives on player performance. Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries are utilized to generate interactive visualizations of player rating trends, comparative analyses, and match outcome predictions.
 By combining statistical rating models with machine learning algorithms, the project aims to demonstrate how hybrid approaches can improve rating precision and provide actionable insights in competitive environments. This solution can be adapted for online chess platforms, club-level tournaments, and other skill-based ranking systems requiring predictive analytics and performance monitoring.
